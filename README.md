MlkShk OS X Client
==================

I wanted to see how far I could get on a basic MlkShk client...

it doesn't do much of anything at the moment... you log in, then it shows you the last few updates from your friends.


TODO
----

* Decide if I should do more on this ;)
* Fetch more updates (scroll?)
* Save token instead of username / password
* Make the UI something more than "What's the easiest way to show something"
* Test it out on 10.6
* Make the code an order of magnitude less stupid (but no more than that)
